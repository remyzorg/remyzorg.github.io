The development of the interaction between different components in a Web
application has become etremely complexe, in both terms of design and
programming. The coherence of internal interactions and reactions to external
events relying on the concurrency model of Javascript cannot be guarantee. It is
then necessary to propose a cleaner and safer concurrency model improving this
situation. In this context, we present an embedded language for OCaml, namely
Pendulum, which brings expressivity and safety of Esterel-like synchronous
languages to OCaml Web programming, and borrows ideas from Ocsigen and HipHop
frameworks.
